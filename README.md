# Graph Theory course
## Fall 2018

For each implementation, there are two files,

+ Run the 'run.sh' script to get an output
+ 'test.txt' for running the algorithm on.

Also, there is already an output in each directory, in the form of *png* files, which are the output images of the codes.

Algorithms:
